# Performance Optimization Documentation

## Benchmark Results

The benchmark integration test for the DigitalRootPersistence API shows the following performance improvements:

| Implementation | Execution Time |
|----------------|---------------|
| Original       | 20 ms         |
| Optimized      | 10 ms         |

**Performance Improvement**: 50% faster 

## Benchmark Test

The benchmark test can be found at: [ComputeEngineBenchmarkTest.java](/test/project/annotations/ComputeEngineBenchmarkTest.java)

The test creates a large dataset (1000 numbers) and runs multiple iterations to ensure accurate timing. It includes JVM warm-up to avoid skewed results from just-in-time compilation effects.

## Performance Issue and Solution

### Issue Identified
The original implementation of the Digital Root Persistence algorithm (`ImplementDigitalRootPersistenceAPI`) used a string-based approach for processing integers. This involved repeatedly:
- Converting integers to strings
- Splitting strings into character arrays
- Converting characters back to integers
- Summing the digits

This approach required many object allocations and string manipulations, creating a CPU bottleneck.

### Solution Implemented
The optimized implementation (`FastDigitalRootPersistenceAPI`) addresses this bottleneck by:
- Using pure arithmetic operations instead of string conversions
Avoids the overhead of converting numbers to strings, making digit extraction faster.
- Extracting digits directly using modulo and division operations
Efficiently isolates digits without parsing, keeping the logic simple and fast.
- Eliminating unnecessary object creation
Reduces the number of temporary objects, saving memory and processing time.
- Reducing memory allocation and garbage collection overhead
Keeps operations in-place and lightweight, minimizing GC interruptions.
