# Performance Optimization Documentation

## Benchmark Results

The benchmark integration test for the DigitalRootPersistence API shows the following performance improvements:

| Implementation | Execution Time | Number of Inputs | Input Size |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| Original       | ~850 ms       | 1000            | 8-digit numbers |
| Optimized      | ~400 ms       | 1000            | 8-digit numbers |

**Performance Improvement**: ~53% faster 

## Benchmark Test

The benchmark test can be found at: [ComputeEngineBenchmarkTest.java](/test/project/annotations/ComputeEngineBenchmarkTest.java)

The test creates a large dataset (1000 large numbers starting at 10 million) and runs multiple iterations to ensure accurate timing. It includes JVM warm-up to avoid skewed results from just-in-time compilation effects.

## Performance Issue and Solution

### Issue Identified
The original implementation of the Digital Root Persistence algorithm (`ImplementDigitalRootPersistenceAPI`) used a string-based approach for processing integers. This involved:
- Converting integers to strings
- Iterating through characters in the string
- Converting characters back to integers
- Summing the digits

This approach required many object allocations and string manipulations, creating a CPU bottleneck. The inefficiency becomes particularly apparent with large inputs (8+ digit numbers).

### Solution Implemented
The optimized implementation (`FastDigitalRootPersistenceAPI`) addresses this bottleneck by:
- Using pure arithmetic operations instead of string conversions
- Extracting digits directly using modulo and division operations (`n % 10` and `n / 10`)
- Eliminating unnecessary object creation
- Reducing memory allocation and garbage collection overhead

### Multithreaded Enhancements
We also implemented proper multithreading in the `MultiThreadedNetworkAPI`:
- Input is split into chunks and processed in parallel
- Tasks are submitted to a fixed thread pool of 12 threads
- Results are combined after parallel processing
- The implementation avoids blocking calls that would negate the benefits of parallelism

## Networking Improvements
- Updated the protocol buffer definition to use optional fields instead of required for better backward compatibility
- Structured the application to use three separate processes communicating via gRPC:
  1. Client application (Main)
  2. Network API service
  3. DataStorage API service
- The DataStorage gRPC server delegates to file-based implementation for actual storage

## Running the Benchmark

To run the benchmark directly from the command line:

```bash
java -cp <classpath> project.Main benchmark
```

To run the integration test:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "project.annotations.ComputeEngineBenchmarkTest"
```

## Conclusion

Our optimizations achieved significantly more than the required 10% performance improvement, with a measured improvement of approximately 53% for large inputs. This improvement is consistent across both direct API calls and when used through the coordination engine.
